# Auto console log üöÄ

babel-plugin-auto-console-log is a Babel plugin that automatically adds console.log() statements to your JavaScript code. This library is useful for debugging code, as it adds console.log() statements to specific parts of the code so that you can see the values of variables and the results of operations.

The main goal of babel-plugin-auto-console-log is to make code debugging easier and faster by automatically adding console.log() statements to your code. This means that you won't have to manually add console.log() statements to your code every time you need to debug it, which saves time and reduces errors.

# Install

```bash
npm i babel-plugin-auto-console-log --save-dev

or

yarn add babel-plugin-auto-console-log -D 

or

pnpm i babel-plugin-auto-console-log --dev
```

# How to use üìù

Auto Console Log is a Babel transform that can be used both on the client-side and server-side of a JavaScript project.

Here is an example on how you can implement it using the `@babel/standalone` package:

1. Install both packages:
```bash
npm i @babel/standalone babel-plugin-auto-console-log --save-dev
```

2. Register the plugin and create a function to transform your code:
```javascript
import Babel from '@babel/standalone';
import autoConsoleLog from 'babel-plugin-auto-console-log';

Babel.registerPlugin('autoConsoleLog', autoConsoleLog);
```

3. Create a function to transform your code:
```javascript
const transform = (source) =>
    Babel.transform(source, {
      plugins: ['autoConsoleLog']
    }).code;
```

4. You are now ready to transform your code! using the `transform()` function.

### Here is the complete code:

```javascript
import Babel from '@babel/standalone';
import autoConsoleLog from 'auto-console-log';

Babel.registerPlugin('autoConsoleLog', autoConsoleLog);

const transform = (source) =>
    Babel.transform(source, {
      plugins: ['autoConsoleLog']
    }).code;
```
